# Buy-and-sell

**Context:** Buy-and-sell is the nickname for the current Mento mechanism which uses an AMM between the market and the reserve and allows the market to buy or sell CELO for a stable asset amount equivalent with the off-chain fiat price of CELO. This enables an arbitrage loop which keeps the stable assets pegged to their fiat counterparts.

We will use this section of the repo as the base to simulation additions to the existing protocol, the first of which is a circuit beaker.
